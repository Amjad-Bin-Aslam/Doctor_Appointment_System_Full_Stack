## üìñ Project Description

This project is a **Doctor Appointment Booking System** built using **MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS**, integrated with **Stripe** for online payments.  

It provides a complete platform for **admins**, **doctors**, and **patients** to manage appointments efficiently.  
Patients can register, log in, book or cancel appointments, and pay online.  
Doctors can manage their profiles, availability, and view earnings, while admins can manage doctors, their details, and oversee appointments ‚Äî all from a unified admin dashboard.

The **backend** is powered by **Express.js** and **Node.js**, with a **MongoDB** database for secure and scalable data handling.  
The **frontend** and **admin/doctor panels** are built in **React.js**, styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a modern, responsive UI.
